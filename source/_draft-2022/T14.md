Here we go again!... Roxanne is all grown up now she is now married to an investment banker and has a son Aman. There's a fair in town and for old times sake she takes her son with her. Her son recently learnt searching algorithms, and is getting quite good at it. He was telling his mother all about it while coming to the fair. There he sees a gargoyle roller coaster, little did they know that these gargoyles prey on little children. Just as Aman gets on the ride a gargoyle swoops on him and carries him away. Roxanne is deperate to get her son back!. Gargoyles have one weak point they cannot see, they rely on their prey to get to places. But the gargoyle will kill him if he gives straight forward directions. So its based on her son's direction they will be flying. But Roxanne knows her son very well, he will be using the binary search algorithm to direct the gargoyle. Help Roxanne find her son using Binary search algorithm.
