## Problem Of The Day ( Hmm... Lets improve this! )

Dina's last project was a tremendous success thanks to your awesome work. Now she wants to enhance the same project with differently styled acessories. 
She has a new pattern in her mind and is unable to actualize it. Help her create the new pattern. The pattern consists of 4 triangles and a square.
The square is made of 1s and is of size n and two triangles of 0s of side n are placed such that the hypotenuses face down and a side is attached to the square. 
Then two more triangles of size n-1 consisting of 1s are placed such that their hypotenuses touch the hypotenuses of the other two triangles.

Example:

Size=4

0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0

1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1

1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1

1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1

-Input Format

  -Input consists of a single integer N
