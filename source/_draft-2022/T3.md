## Problem Of The Day ( Dominant Elements )

You are given an array A of length N. An element X is said to be dominant if the frequency of X in A is strictly greater than the frequency of any other element in the A.
For example, if A = [2, 1, 4, 4, 4] then 4 is a dominant element since its frequency is higher than the frequency of any other element in A.
Find if there exists any dominant element in A.

  - Input Format:
    - The first line of input contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
    - The first line of each test case contains an integer N — the size of the array A.
    - The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2....AN denoting the array A.
  - Ouput Format:
    - For each test case, output YES if there exists any dominant element in A. Otherwise, output NO.
