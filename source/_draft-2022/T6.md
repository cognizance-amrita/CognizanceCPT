## Problem Of The Day ( Lapindromes )

Lapindrome is defined as a string which when split in the middle, gives two halves having the same characters and same frequency of each character.
If there are odd number of characters in the string, we ignore the middle character and check for lapindrome. 

For example **gaga** is a lapindrome, since the two halves **ga** and **ga** have the same characters with same frequency. 
Also, **abccab**, **rotor** and **xyzxy** are a few examples of lapindromes. Note that **abbaab** is NOT a lapindrome.
The two halves contain the same characters but their frequencies do not match. Your task is simple. Given a string, you need to tell if it is a lapindrome.

  - Input Format:
   - First line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
   - Each test is a single line containing a string S composed of only lowercase English alphabet.
  - Ouput Format:
    - For each test case, output on a separate line: "YES" if the string is a lapindrome and "NO" if it is not.
